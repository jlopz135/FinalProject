            <div style="clear: left;">
                <p>GOOOOOL! That's the typical sound you hear when you score a goal. The basics of soccer are straightforward. In soccer, there is a ball that is kicked around on a field with the purpose of scoring in a designated area.
                What's a goal? That's when the ball goes past the line and into the designated area. On the field, there are 11 players on the field, per team. Each team has 1 goalie and that goalie is the only player that can use their hands, as long as they are in their 18 yard box.
                Teammates can pass the ball to each other, with any body part besides their hands, and get the ball to the opposing teams goal. If the ball goes out of bounds, then an overhead throw must be taken in order to resume play. The game lasts 90 minutes with two 45 minute halves. Overtime can occur in must win situations.
                If someone is fouled inside the opposite teams goalie box, or there is no winner at the end of overtime, then a penalty must occur. A penalty is a free shot from a spot in the middle of the box, 1 on 1 with the goalie. The game always ends in a win or a draw, depending if it is a tournament game or not. You now know the basics to play Soccer. Have Fun!</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This is a beautiful example by Arsenal on how a goal can be scored by passing the ball. The red team, Arsenal, passed the ball wonderfully and ended the play with the ball in the back of the other teams net, scoring a goal.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This is a penalty kick. The shooter's team was fouled inside the penalty box and was rewarded a penalty shot. The goalie has a chance to save his team from being scored on. This is quite nerve-wracking.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">The best feeling in this sport has to be winning. In order to win, you must score! Scoring a goal calls for celebration since it is no easy task. Break out your best dance moves or walk that walk. You deserve it.</p>

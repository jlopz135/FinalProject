                <p>The game can be traced back to ancient China, Rome, Greece, and Central America, but it was England who claimed it first as an organized sport.
                In around the 19th century, teams, uniforms, and leagues were created in England in order to create the first official scene for soccer. However, the Aztecs had a game called <em>Tchatali</em> which
                can be considered the first form of soccer. </p>
                <p>Early forms of soccer were seen with the objective of keeping the ball in the air without the use of hands. Points were earned by putting the ball through a hole of some sort. In England, it was even
                reported that once the ball ended up being kicked, people would use fists to fend off defenders. How crazy is that?</p>

                <p>The first "soccer ball" can be considered, in today's terms, a rock. People would see a rock and kick it with purpose, which in it's simplest form, is soccer.
                Eventually, people started to use animal leather put together into a spherical form in order to roll. This ball would be kicked among those involved. There were even some reports that pig's bladder would be used like a hacky-sack. <em>GROSS.</em></p>
                <p>Thankfully, the ball has evolved past that form. In 1862, a rubber ball was introduced in order to reduce how much the ball lost its shape after being used. In 1872, there was a need to get an official size and weight for soccer games. 27 to 28 inches was the circumference.
                Eventually the material continued to be evolved and changed in order to maximize durability and create designs. Today, beautiful soccer balls are made, all with unique designs to kick off the soccer season. </p>

                <p>Today, soccer is one of, if not, the most popular sports in the world. It is international and knows no race, gender, or ethnicity. The beautiful game has received this nickname due to its ability to unite people. The world regions made six confederations, CAF, AFC, UEFA, CONCACAF, OFC, and CONMEBOL.
                So many emotions, memories, and crucial parts of history can be seen in soccer. In 1914, the Germans and English cease fired on Christmas day in WW1, and decided to verse each other in a game of soccer. Imagine that! Soccer is a sport that has always been part of history, and will continue to be.   </p>
